                        academic scene – Government College, Borda Margao.
                        Established in 2010, this institution was born out of a
                        pressing need to cater to the educational aspirations of
                        students from Margao who faced challenges in gaining
                        admission to reputed colleges. Over the past fourteen
                        years, the college has not only addressed this gap but
                        has also set new benchmarks in higher education with its
                        state-of-the-art infrastructure, innovative programs,

                        Hon. Chief Minister Dr. Pramod Sawant's strategic
                        foresight has provided a robust foundation for the

                        His relentless efforts in streamlining administrative
                        processes, facilitating collaborations, and ensuring
                        adherence to academic standards have contributed
